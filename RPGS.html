            <h2>What is the difference?</h2>
                <h4>Western RPGS</h4>
                <p>Western RPGs are a subgenre of role-playing games that follow a style popularized by Western computer developers. They typically feature more open-ended gameplay, character customization, and branching narratives than their Eastern counterparts. Some examples of Western RPGs are The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Mass Effect, and The Witcher series.</p>

                <p>Computer role-playing games (CRPGs) are once again popular. Recent titles, such as BioWare's Mass Effect series and Bethesda Softworks' The Elder Scrolls series, have been produced for console systems and have received multi-platform releases, although independently developed games are frequently created as personal computer (PC) exclusives. Developers of role-playing games have continuously experimented with various graphical perspectives and styles of play, such as real-time and turn-based time-keeping systems, axonometric and first-person graphical projections, and single-character or multi-character parties. Subgenres include action role-playing games, roguelikes and tactical role-playing games.</p>

                <h3>Eastern RPGS</h3>
                <p>Eastern RPGs are a subgenre of role-playing video games that originated in Japan and are influenced by Japanese culture and mythology. They typically feature turn-based combat, linear storytelling, and predefined characters. Eastern RPGs can be further divided into Japanese RPGs (JRPGs), Korean RPGs (KRPGs), Chinese RPGs (CRPGs), and others.</p>

                <p>The history of Eastern RPGs dates back to 1982, when Japan's earliest RPGs were released. They were inspired by Western Computer RPGs like Wizardry or Ultima. Some of the most influential and popular Eastern RPGs include Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Pok√©mon, Chrono Trigger, Persona, and The Legend of Zelda. In most Eastern RPGS developers tend to simplify rpg elements of the game to make them more accessible or due to hardware limitations due to the fact so many Eastern RPGS are released in console rather than on PC.</p>
